  Break operator causes the enclosing for, while or do-while loop or
switch statement to terminate. Used when it is otherwise awkward to
terminate the loop using the condition expression and conditional
statements.
  The syntax of a break statement in C++ is âˆ’ break; The break
statement has two separate and distinct uses: exiting a loop, and
exiting a switch statement. You cannot use a break anywhere but inside
a loop or a switch statement. After this statement the control is
transferred to the statement or declaration immediately following the
enclosing loop or switch.
  A break statement cannot be used to break out of multiple nested
loops, the goto statement may be used for this purpose. If you are
using nested loops, the break statement will stop the execution of the
innermost loop and start executing the next line of code after the
block.
