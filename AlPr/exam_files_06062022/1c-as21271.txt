Vectors used when you don't know size of container.
In C++ vectors, automatic reallocation happens whenever the total amount of memory is used.
Insertation in the end is fast.
Vectors might consume more memory then an array. Insertation in not the end is slower then in the end.
Resizing before adding new member doubles the temporarily, as the previous vector buffer must held until
copied from.
Vectors are good for caching the data.
Mmap allows fast access to the value using the key.
This property is useful when building any kind of index or reference.
Second, the map ensures that a key is unique across the entire data structure,
which is an excellent technique for avoiding duplication of data.
